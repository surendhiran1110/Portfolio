I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

So let's get started! Some of the info below is pretty self-explanatory, like 'firstName' and 'bio'. I'll try to explain anything

of what each of the values mean.

    bio: "Greetings! I'm Surendhiran S, a passionate cloud engineer with a background in Information Technology from Karpagam Institute of Technology. I thrive on delving into the intricacies of cloud systems and leveraging technology to solve complex problems. Recently, I have enhanced my skill set by learning various DevOps tools such as Git for version control, and GitHub Actions for creating and integrating CI/CD pipelines. I have also gained proficiency in Docker for containerization, Terraform, Kubernetes (K8S), and basic Linux commands. Additionally, I have delved into file handling management using Python scripting. My hands-on experience extends to various AWS services, including EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudFront. These tools and technologies have allowed me to undertake and complete several hands-on projects, further solidifying my expertise. I'm excited about the endless possibilities that cloud computing combined with DevOps offers and am eager to contribute my skills to meaningful projects."
